## Introduction
Hello, I'm Chirag! I'm passionate about data science and analytics, economics and like a little bit of reinforcement learning. Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, projects, and experiences.

## Background
I come from India, where I've been living my entire life. My journey in data science started when I had saw some lectures on Deep learning from IIT Kharagpur. Later on I got opportunity to research on a [deep learing topic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10007491). CPresently, I collaborate with ZS Associates, where my role involves analyzing patient-level claims and EMR data. This analysis serves to derive actionable business insights tailored for pharmaceutical industry leaders. 

## Interests
- **Hobbies:** In my free time, I enjoy playing clash of clans, and try to stay from that X app.
- **Favorites:** [Canon in D by Pachelbel](https://youtu.be/JvNQLJ1_HQ0?si=Be_t8KCBiIxyIlxY) (close your eyes and give it a try).

## Projects
I'm currently working on a creating a python library called lprocess.
The idea is to create a library that can make the Exploratory data analysis easier and accessible to folks who are new to the field of data science and analytics.
Here is the initial version of it: [lprocess](https://pypi.org/project/lprocess/)
Feel free to test it and let me know in case of any bugs :)
