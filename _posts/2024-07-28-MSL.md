## Introduction

Pharmaceutical companies are complex organizations with a variety of departments working in concert to bring new treatments to market and ensure their safe and effective use. These departments typically include pre-clinical trials, clinical trials, medical affairs, sales, marketing, operations, manufacturing, legal, and finance. Among these, medical affairs plays a crucial role that is distinct from the commercial branch, with a broader scope that often includes increased budgets.
The Scope of Medical Affairs

Medical affairs encompasses several core activities such as field force operations led by Medical Science Liaisons (MSLs), medical communications, and medical information. Additionally, the scope of medical affairs can include compliance and regulatory affairs, Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR), Key Opinion Leader (KOL) management, investigator-initiated trials, and publication support. On average, 50% of the medical affairs budget is allocated to MSLs.
Key Activities of Medical Affairs

Medical Science Liaisons (MSLs):
        1.	MSLs are dedicated to educating physicians, opinion leaders, and other stakeholders in a non-promotional and unbiased manner.
        2.	They respond to unsolicited requests for information, both on-label and off-label.
        3.	MSLs play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between the pharmaceutical company and the medical community by providing scientific and clinical information.

Medical Communications:
        1.	This includes the dissemination of scientific data and information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and other stakeholders.
        2.	It ensures that accurate and up-to-date information is available to those who need it.

Medical Information:
        1.	Medical information departments handle queries from HCPs and other stakeholders, ensuring they receive accurate and reliable information about the company’s products.

Country and Company-Dependent Activities

    Compliance/Regulatory Affairs: Ensuring that all activities comply with local and international regulations.
    Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR): Assessing the economic impact and outcomes of healthcare interventions.
    Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Management: Engaging with influential medical professionals to gather insights and support product development and marketing strategies.
    Investigator-Initiated Trials: Supporting independent research initiated by investigators outside the company.
    Publication Support: Assisting in the preparation and submission of scientific publications.

## The Importance of Separation from Commercial Activities

Due to heavy fines and regulatory concerns, many medical affairs departments maintain strict boundaries between their operations and commercial activities. For example, they do not share physician lists or interaction data with the sales department, and MSLs and sales representatives do not visit physicians together. This separation is essential to ensure that medical affairs activities are unbiased and not influenced by commercial interests.
FDA Guidance on Off-Label Communication

In 2011, the FDA issued guidance for the industry concerning off-label communication, outlining what constitutes ‘solicited’ versus ‘unsolicited’ information. For instance, if a sales representative invites healthcare providers (HCPs) to request more information, it is considered solicited. MSLs must handle these interactions carefully to avoid promoting off-label uses.
Understanding Off-Label Information

Off-label information refers to any data about unapproved or uncleared indications or conditions of use for a product. This type of information is crucial because the pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated, not just in terms of product development but also in the communication allowed regarding these products.
Reasons for HCP Requests for Off-Label Information

1. Data not included in the product insert.
2. Specific adverse events.
3. Product pipeline information in a competitive context.
4. Product data not approved by the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP).
5. Subset analyses of clinical or registry data.
6. Any non-approved dialogue.

## Trends in Medical Affairs and Sales

Between 2005 and 2009, the number of sales representatives in the top 25 pharmaceutical companies decreased by 21%, while the number of MSLs increased by 133%. This shift highlights the growing importance of MSLs in the pharmaceutical industry.

## The Role of MSLs

MSLs are dedicated to educating physicians, KOLs, and regulatory agencies without engaging in promotional activities. They are often considered the scientific face of the company. The key drivers of MSL value include their therapeutic knowledge, understanding of customer needs, and ability to build strong relationships with stakeholders.

## Conclusion

Medical affairs play a vital role in pharmaceutical companies by ensuring that healthcare professionals and other stakeholders receive accurate, unbiased information about products and treatments. The separation between medical affairs and commercial activities is essential to maintain the integrity of this information. As the industry continues to evolve, the role of MSLs and other medical affairs professionals will remain crucial in bridging the gap between science and clinical practice.
