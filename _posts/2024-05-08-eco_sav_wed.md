At most weddings, guests arrive to bless, greet, and show their affection for the newlyweds. However, there is one unstated but common practice that occurs in most regions of the world: gifts are given to the newlyweds. People frequently lack perfect knowledge about what other people might bring, so some choose to give something they can afford, which is perfectly reasonable (and advised). However, a small percentage of people try to learn more about other people, which has an impact on their choice of gifts. This situation is exactly what happens at every wedding, and these kinds of things, including making fun of people, are discussed after the ceremony.


*From this part the story becomes cruel, reader discretion in advised*

Imagine now that this is the nuptials of some savage couple whose aim is to extract as much value as possible from every possible gift. These pair, who are somewhat of a capitalist couple, set up a situation in which each invitation includes an optional real-time summary of the gifts that each invitee is bringing in descending order. This kind of incites rivalry among the invitees, and when there is rivalry, the consumer wins. In this case, the consumers are only this pair, and every invitee is vying to be at the top of the list. At this point, one could argue that this would not happen in such a dramatic way and that the only individuals who would fall victim to this trap are those who have an abundance of money and who prioritize their social standing above all else. Although this hypothesis hasn't been put to the test and I wouldn't advise trying it, I am confident that the pair will always come out ahead in the later scenario because that is just how things work. The world operates in just this manner, with a small number of outliers on both ends of the distribution.
