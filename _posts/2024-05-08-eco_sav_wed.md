At most weddings, guests arrive to bless, greet, and show their affection for the newlyweds. However, there is one unstated but common practice that occurs in most regions of the world: gifts are given to the newlyweds. People frequently lack perfect knowledge about what other people might bring, so some choose to give something they can afford, which is perfectly reasonable (and advised). However, a small percentage of people try to learn more about other people, which has an impact on their choice of gifts. This situation is exactly what happens at every wedding, and these kinds of things, including making fun of people, are discussed after the ceremony.


*From this part the story becomes cruel, reader discretion in advised*

Now, imagine a wedding of some barbaric couple whose goal is to maximize the value of each potential gift they would get. These couple know a thing or two about capitalism, so they arrange a scenario where every invitation contains a optional real-time information of the gifts invitees are bringing in descending fashion. This sort of creates a competition among invitees and when there is competition the consumer benefits and here the consumers are just these couple and ALL the invitees are competing to get their names as top of the list as possible. At this point, one could argue that this would not happen in such a dramatic way and that the only individuals who would fall victim to this trap are those who have an abundance of money and who prioritize their social standing above all else. Although this hypothesis hasn't been put to the test and I wouldn't advise trying it, I am confident that the pair will always come out ahead in the later scenario because that is just how things work. The world operates in just this manner, with a small number of outliers on both ends of the distribution.
